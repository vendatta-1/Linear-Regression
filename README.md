# Ames Housing Price Prediction Project

This project uses the **Ames Housing dataset** to build a regression model for predicting house prices. The dataset is accompanied by an `Ames_housing.txt` file, which describes the dataset's features and their meanings.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and interpretable predictive model for house prices using a systematic approach that includes data analysis, preprocessing, and model tuning.

## Steps in the Project

### 1. **Dataset Description**
- The dataset is based on the **Ames Housing dataset** and includes details about residential property sales in Ames, Iowa.
- The accompanying `Ames_housing.txt` file provides a comprehensive description of the dataset's features and their meanings.

### 2. **Data Insights**
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the relationships between features.
- Computed correlations between the target variable (`SalePrice`) and other features to identify significant predictors.

### 3. **Handling Outliers**
- Addressed outliers in the dataset to avoid excessive row deletions.
- Focused on removing only three rows with extreme values to maintain the integrity of the dataset.

### 4. **Dealing with Missing Data**
- Handled missing values based on the dataset description provided in `Ames_housing.txt`.
- Ensured that the preprocessing steps align with the dataset's documented characteristics.

### 5. **Model Development**
- Used an **Elastic Net Regression Model** for prediction, which combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties.
- Instead of using default parameters, performed hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV** to find the optimal combination of parameters.

### 6. **Model Deployment**
- Deployed the trained model locally using **Joblib** for serialization and deserialization.
